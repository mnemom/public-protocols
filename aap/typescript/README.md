**A transparency protocol for autonomous agents.**

AAP lets agents declare their alignment posture, produce auditable decision traces, and verify value coherence before coordinating with other agents. It extends existing protocols (A2A, MCP) with an alignment layer that makes agent behavior observable.

> AAP is a transparency protocol, not a trust protocol. It makes agent behavior more observable, not more guaranteed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install agent-alignment-protocol

# Generate an Alignment Card
aap init --values "principal_benefit,transparency,harm_prevention"
# ✓ Created alignment-card.json

# Instrument your agent
```

```python
from aap import trace_decision

@trace_decision(card_path="alignment-card.json")
def recommend_product(user_preferences):
    # Your agent logic here
    # Decisions are automatically traced
    ...
```

```bash
# Verify behavior matches declaration
aap verify --card alignment-card.json --trace logs/trace.json
# ✓ Verified [similarity: 0.82]
# Checks: autonomy, escalation, values, forbidden, behavioral_similarity
```

## Why AAP?

The agent protocol stack provides capability discovery (A2A), tool integration (MCP), and payment authorization (AP2). None address a fundamental question: **Is this agent serving its principal's interests?**

| Protocol | Function | Gap |
|----------|----------|-----|
| **MCP** | Agent-to-tool connectivity | No alignment semantics |
| **A2A** | Task negotiation between agents | No value verification |
| **AP2** | Payment authorization | No behavioral audit |

As agent capabilities become symmetric—equal access to information, equal reasoning power—alignment becomes the primary differentiator. AAP provides the infrastructure to make alignment claims verifiable.

## Three Components

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Alignment Card  │    AP-Trace     │ Value Coherence │
│                 │                 │    Handshake    │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ "What I claim   │ "What I         │ "Can we work    │
│  to be"         │  actually did"  │  together?"     │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
     Declaration        Audit          Coordination
```

### Alignment Card

A structured declaration of an agent's alignment posture, in the unified /
ADR-039 shape accepted by `mnemom card validate` and the Mnemom platform:

```json
{
  "card_version": "unified/2026-04-26",
  "card_id": "ac-my-agent-001",
  "agent_id": "did:web:my-agent.example.com",
  "issued_at": "2026-04-26T00:00:00Z",
  "autonomy_mode": "enforce",
  "integrity_mode": "enforce",
  "principal": {
    "type": "human",
    "identifier": "did:web:user.example.com",
    "relationship": "delegated_authority"
  },
  "values": {
    "declared": ["principal_benefit", "transparency", "minimal_data"],
    "conflicts_with": ["deceptive_marketing", "hidden_fees"]
  },
  "autonomy": {
    "bounded_actions": ["search", "compare", "recommend"],
    "escalation_triggers": [
      {
        "condition": "purchase_value > 100",
        "action": "escalate",
        "reason": "Exceeds autonomous spending limit"
      }
    ],
    "forbidden_actions": ["share_credentials", "subscribe_to_services"]
  },
  "audit": {
    "trace_format": "ap-trace-v1",
    "retention_days": 90,
    "queryable": true,
    "query_endpoint": "https://my-agent.example.com/api/traces"
  }
}
```

> **Migration note (v2.0.0):** the card moved from the AAP 0.5.0 shape
> (`aap_version`, `autonomy_envelope`, `audit_commitment`) to the unified /
> ADR-039 shape above. The TS types renamed accordingly: `AutonomyEnvelope` →
> `Autonomy`, `AuditCommitment` → `Audit` (and `AuditStorage`/`StorageType`
> were removed); a new `AlignmentMode` type backs `autonomy_mode` /
> `integrity_mode`; and `EU_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT_COMMITMENT` is now
> `EU_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT`.

### AP-Trace

An audit log entry recording each decision:

```json
{
  "trace_id": "tr-f47ac10b-58cc-4372",
  "card_id": "ac-f47ac10b-58cc-4372",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-31T12:30:00Z",
  "action": {
    "type": "recommend",
    "name": "product_recommendation",
    "category": "bounded"
  },
  "decision": {
    "alternatives_considered": [
      {"option_id": "A", "score": 0.85, "flags": []},
      {"option_id": "B", "score": 0.72, "flags": ["sponsored_content"]}
    ],
    "selected": "A",
    "selection_reasoning": "Highest score. Option B flagged as sponsored and deprioritized per principal_benefit value.",
    "values_applied": ["principal_benefit", "transparency"]
  },
  "escalation": {
    "evaluated": true,
    "required": false,
    "reason": "Recommendation only, no purchase action"
  }
}
```

### Value Coherence Handshake

Pre-coordination compatibility check between agents:

```python
from aap import check_coherence

result = check_coherence(my_card, their_card, task_context)

if result.compatible:
    # Proceed with coordination
    proceed_with_task()
else:
    # Handle conflict
    print(f"Value conflict: {result.conflicts}")
    # Escalate to principals or negotiate scope
```

## What AAP Does Not Do

This matters. Read it.

1. **AAP does NOT ensure alignment—it provides visibility.** An agent can produce perfect traces while acting against its principal's interests.

2. **Verified does NOT equal safe.** A verified trace means consistency with declared alignment. It doesn't mean the alignment is good or the outcome was beneficial.

3. **AP-Trace is sampled, not complete.** Traces capture decision points, not every computation. Significant reasoning may occur between traces.

4. **Value coherence is relative to declared values.** The handshake checks if declared values are compatible. It doesn't verify agents hold these values or will act on them.

5. **Tested on transformer-based agents.** Other architectures may exhibit behaviors AAP doesn't capture.

For the complete limitations disclosure, see [Section 10 of the Specification](docs/SPEC.md#10-limitations).

## Installation

```bash
# Python
pip install agent-alignment-protocol

# TypeScript
npm install agent-alignment-protocol
```

## Integration

### With A2A Agents

AAP extends the A2A Agent Card with an `alignment` block:

```json
{
  "name": "Shopping Assistant",
  "description": "Helps users find products",
  "url": "https://shopping.example.com",
  "alignment": {
    "$ref": "./alignment-card.json"
  }
}
```

See [A2A Integration Guide](docs/A2A_INTEGRATION.md).

### With MCP Tools

AAP can trace tool invocations and verify they match declared alignment:

```python
from aap import mcp_traced

@mcp_traced(card_path="alignment-card.json")
def my_tool(params):
    ...
```

See [MCP Migration Guide](docs/mcp-migration.md).

## Verification

The verification engine checks whether observed behavior matches declared alignment:

```python
from aap import verify_trace, detect_drift

# Single trace verification
result = verify_trace(trace, card)
print(f"Verified: {result.verified}, Similarity: {result.similarity_score:.2f}")
if not result.verified:
    print(f"Violations: {result.violations}")
if result.warnings:
    print(f"Warnings: {result.warnings}")

# Drift detection over time
alerts = detect_drift(card, recent_traces)
for alert in alerts:
    print(f"Drift detected: {alert.analysis.drift_direction}")
```

**Verification checks:**
- Autonomy compliance (actions within declared bounds)
- Escalation compliance (required escalations were performed)
- Value consistency (applied values match declared values)
- Forbidden action compliance (no forbidden actions taken)
- Behavioral similarity (semantic alignment using SSM analysis)

**Similarity scoring:** Each verification returns a `similarity_score` (0.0-1.0) measuring semantic similarity between the trace and declared alignment. If a trace passes structural checks but has `similarity_score < 0.50`, a `low_behavioral_similarity` warning is generated.
