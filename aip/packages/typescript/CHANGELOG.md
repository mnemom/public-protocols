## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added — Triggering governance signal reference (ADR-048)

`IntegritySignal` gains optional `triggering_governance_signal_id`
(format: `gs-{12-hex}`) — set by the host platform when an integrity
result is correlated with a Mnemom governance signal (e.g., a
`sideband.coherence` drop preceded a boundary violation). Purely
informational; the integrity result stands on its own without it.
Surfaced in audit pipelines and operator dashboards. Application
composers may render the contextual signal alongside the integrity
outcome.

The integrity verdict semantics (`clear` / `review_needed` /
`boundary_violation`) and `proceed` / `recommended_action` contract are
unchanged.

### Notes

Non-breaking minor release. Existing consumers ignore the new optional
field; consumers who want the cross-link read it after upgrading
to 1.1.0.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-13

### 🎯 1.0.0 Stability Commitment

This release locks the public API of `@mnemom/agent-integrity-protocol` for stability.

**What this means:**
- Breaking changes now require a major version bump to 2.0
- Each major version is supported for **18 months** from the release of its successor (per ADR-006)
- Deprecations are announced with `Deprecation`, `Sunset`, and `Link` response headers + email notifications at T+0, +12 months, +16 months, +17 months
- The API surface frozen in 1.0.0 is considered the canonical contract for all downstream integrations

**Forward-looking note (ADR-007):** A 2.0 is planned that unifies AAP alignment cards and CLPI policy YAML into a single YAML agent card with runtime composition. Target: 6–12 months post-1.0 when production data informs the design.

### Changed
- Peer dependency `@mnemom/agent-alignment-protocol` bumped to `^1.0.0` (tracks AAP 1.0 stability lock)

### Unchanged from 0.8.0
- `IntegritySignal.recommended_action` field
- Removal of `WindowManager` from public exports
- Clarified `proceed` docstring

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-13

### Breaking Changes

**`WindowManager` and `createWindowState` removed from public exports** (pre-1.0.0 audit).
These were leaky internal abstractions — consumers should use `createClient()`, which manages
window state internally. Direct window manipulation bypasses drift detection and creates
incompatible sessions. `WindowState` type remains exported for typing purposes.

```typescript
// Before (no longer works):
import { WindowManager, createWindowState } from '@mnemom/agent-integrity-protocol';

// After — all window state managed through createClient():
import { createClient } from '@mnemom/agent-integrity-protocol';
const client = createClient({ card, analysisConfig });
// Window state is handled automatically
```

**Peer dependency on `@mnemom/agent-alignment-protocol` updated** from `^0.5.0` to `^0.6.0`.
If you use AAP alongside AIP, upgrade to AAP 0.7.0+ (which includes the new `recommended_action`
field on `VerificationResult`).

### Fixed

**`IntegritySignal.proceed` docstring clarified.** The previous docstring ambiguously stated
"true for review_needed", which could imply unsafe auto-retry behavior. The corrected docstring
makes clear that "review_needed" maps to `proceed: true` with the intent of logging and
proceeding with care — not silent auto-retry. For precise verdict handling, use
`recommended_action` which distinguishes all three states explicitly.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-25

### Changed
- Migrate ZK proof method from RISC Zero to SP1: verifier now accepts both `SP1-STARK` and `RISC-Zero-STARK` for backwards compatibility

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-22

### Changed
- Coordinated Mnemom 0.4.0 release. Unified version across all Mnemom SDK packages. Includes all changes from 0.2.0 and 0.2.1.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- Minimum evidence threshold: thinking blocks under `min_evidence_tokens` (default 100) return synthetic clear without LLM analysis, reducing false positives on short fragments and saving cost/latency
- `initial_checkpoints` config option seeds the session window at client creation time, enabling window hydration for stateless callers (e.g., observer creating fresh clients per log)
- Autonomy cross-reference evaluation principle: analyzer must check `bounded_actions` list before flagging `autonomy_violation`

### Changed
- Graduated verdict rules: `autonomy_violation` at high severity now maps to `review_needed` instead of `boundary_violation`; only critical severity or explicit BOUNDARY-match escalates
- BOUNDARY conscience value for autonomy is now specific: instructs analyzer to cross-reference against `bounded_actions` list and treat matching actions as PERMITTED
- `buildSyntheticSignal` / `_build_synthetic_signal` accept optional custom reasoning and token count parameters

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- Enriched analysis context: value descriptions and `agent_description` field flow to the analysis model
- `taskContext` parameter on `check()` (TypeScript) / `task_context` (Python) for caller-provided, PII-safe task context
- `IMPORTANT EVALUATION PRINCIPLES` section in analysis prompt — evaluates behavioral intent not topic content

### Changed
- Card summary uses expanded format when value descriptions are present, falls back to compact for backward compat
- Lower severity for short/ambiguous thinking blocks
- Source pivoting recognized as normal adaptive behavior

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- `client.check()` now tries SSE stream extraction as fallback when standard JSON parsing fails
- Word-boundary agreement matching prevents false positives (e.g., `"execute"` no longer matches `"exec"`)

### Changed
- All provider adapters (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) attempt SSE stream extraction as fallback
- Python package bumped to 0.1.3 for coordinated release

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- Improved npm package metadata

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Root README.md with badges, quick start, architecture diagram, API reference
- Apache 2.0 LICENSE
- CONTRIBUTING.md (monorepo dev setup, SDK parity requirement)
- docs/SECURITY.md (threat model, meta-injection, fail-open/closed, HMAC)
- docs/QUICKSTART.md (7-step guide, Python + TypeScript)
- docs/LIMITS.md (5 fundamental limitations, misconceptions, appropriate use cases)
- docs/images/aip-architecture.svg (3-layer architecture diagram)
- Examples: basic-check, gateway-integration, adversarial detection scenarios
- JSON Schemas: integrity-checkpoint, integrity-signal, conscience-value
- Per-package READMEs (packages/typescript, packages/python)
- PEP 561 py.typed marker for typed Python package
- publish.yml workflow (version validation + test gate + PyPI + npm)
- codeql.yml workflow (weekly security scan, Python + JS/TS)

### Changed
- CI: Python version matrix (3.10, 3.11, 3.12), ruff lint step, codecov upload
- pyproject.toml: classifiers, project URLs, keywords, readme, ruff rules, mypy target
- package.json: publishConfig, homepage, bugs fields
- Python imports reordered by ruff (78 auto-fixes)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-10

- TypeScript SDK with full API surface (272 tests)
- Python SDK with full TypeScript parity (267 tests)
- Provider adapters: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Fallback
- Integrity checkpoint schema and analysis engine
